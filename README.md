# Tamagotchi

This is a JavaScript application that simulates a virtual pet, so called "Tamagotchi". The application creates a pet prototype with properties for name, animal type, tiredness, hunger, loneliness, and happiness, and methods connected to buttons to simulate the virtual pet's activities such as playing, eating, and napping. There is an interval that continuously decreases the Tamagotchi's needs, and a method to check if the Tamagotchi is dead.

The application interface is built with HTML and SASS with a progress bar for its needs. There are buttons to interact with the Tamagotchi, and messages to display the result of each action. If one of the Tamagotchi's needs reach zero, it dies and the user is prompted to restart the game.
